# Retrospective Meeting 2 - 18.05.2023
## What worked well? Positive Highlights & Achievements:
- Positive Team Assistance: Team members displayed a remarkable commitment to supporting each other, significantly boosting overall productivity and fostering a positive work environment.
- Effective Team Communication: Our internal communication systems and practices have proved to be effective, facilitating smoother workflows and better collaboration.
- Security Enhancements: We have successfully made considerable progress in our security operations with the successful implementation of Fail2Ban and key-based SSH authentication.

## What could be improved? Identified Areas for Improvement:
- Branch Management: After a feature branch's associated Pull Request (PR) is approved, the branch should be promptly deleted to maintain a clean and manageable codebase.
- Use of Draft PRs: We need to better utilize Draft PRs as a way to indicate ongoing work, thereby improving transparency and collaboration during the development phase.

## What will we commit to improve? Action items:
- Adopting Proactive Draft PR Practice: To promote transparency, we will adopt a new standard practice of creating a Draft PR whenever a new feature branch is created. This will ensure visibility and encourage collaborative feedback during the development process.
- Feature Branch Deletion Post-Approval: To maintain the tidiness of our codebase, we will ensure to delete each feature branch promptly once its associated PR has been approved and merged, following GitHub's recommendations.
