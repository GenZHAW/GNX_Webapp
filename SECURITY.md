## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, please report them via email to security@dylanas.ch. If possible, encrypt your message with the PGP key found below.

- Type of the found issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Full paths of the affected files
- Location of the affected source code (direct URL or tag/branch/commit)
- Steps to reproduce the issue (including any necessary prerequisites)
- If applicable, proof of concept
- Brief explanation how an attacker might exploit the issue and what its impact is upon successful exploitation

Please note that we do not operate a bug bounty program at this point.
