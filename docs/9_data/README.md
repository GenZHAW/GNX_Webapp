# Data

## Data Storage 

The Genetix Webapp stores data in a SQL database, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL. The database schema is designed to support the various data entities required by the application, including registration codes, users, teams, and team types. 

## Data Models 

The data models used by the Genetix Webapp are defined using an object-relational mapping (ORM) tool, such as Sequelize. The models are defined in the server/models directory and follow the following conventions: 

* Each model is defined in a separate file.
* The model file exports a Sequelize model instance.
* The model definition includes fields for each data attribute, including data types, constraints, and default values.
* The model definition includes relationships with other models, using Sequelize associations. 

## Data Access 

Data access in the Genetix Webapp is performed using a data access layer (DAL), which is responsible for communicating with the database and providing an API for other application components to interact with the data. The DAL is implemented using Sequelize, and is defined in the server/dal directory. 

The DAL provides a set of methods for each data entity, including CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) and other operations specific to the entity. For example, the RegistrationCode entity provides methods for creating new codes, deactivating valid codes, and reactivating expired codes. 

## Data Migration 

When changes are made to the database schema or data models, data migration is required to ensure that existing data is updated to match the new schema. Data migration is performed using a tool such as Sequelize migrations, which allow for incremental changes to the database schema over time. 

Migrations are defined in the server/migrations directory, and are organized into separate files for each migration. Each migration file includes a description of the changes being made, and the changes themselves, using Sequelize methods for modifying the database schema. 

## Data Validation 

Data validation in the Genetix Webapp is performed using a validation layer, which is responsible for ensuring that data is consistent and conforms to the expected format. Validation is performed both on the client side, using JavaScript, and on the server side, using Sequelize validation methods. 

Validation rules are defined in the data models themselves, using Sequelize validation methods. For example, the User model includes validation rules for ensuring that the email address is unique and that the password meets minimum complexity requirements. 

## Data Backup and Recovery 

To ensure that data is backed up and recoverable in case of disaster or data loss, the Genetix Webapp implements a backup and recovery process. This process includes regular backups of the database, stored on a separate storage device or in the cloud, and a recovery process in case of data loss. 

The backup process is performed using a tool such as mysqldump, which creates a backup file containing a snapshot of the database. The recovery process involves restoring the backup file to a new database instance, and then updating the application configuration to point to the new database. 

## Data Privacy and Security 

Data privacy and security are critical concerns for the Genetix Webapp, as it contains sensitive data such as user and team information. To ensure data privacy and security, the application follows the following best practices: 

* Encryption: Sensitive data such as passwords and registration codes are stored in the database using encryption, using a secure algorithm such as bcrypt. 

* Authentication and authorization: Users must authenticate with the application using their email address and password, and are authorized to perform certain actions based on their role (e.g. administrator or team member).
