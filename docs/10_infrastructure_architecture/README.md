# Infrastructure Architecture

## Introduction 

The Genetix Webapp is a cloud-based web application that runs on a scalable, fault-tolerant infrastructure. The infrastructure is designed to support the expected load of the application, and to ensure high availability and reliability. 

## Architecture Overview 

The infrastructure architecture of the Genetix Webapp is composed of several components, including: 

* Web server: The web server is responsible for serving web requests to clients, and is implemented using a web server such as Nginx or Apache.
* Application server: The application server is responsible for running the Node.js application code, and is implemented using a process manager such as PM2.
* Database server: The database server is responsible for storing and retrieving data, and is implemented using a SQL database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.
* Load balancer: The load balancer is responsible for distributing web requests across multiple web server instances, and is implemented using a load balancing service such as Amazon Elastic Load Balancer or Google Cloud Load Balancing.
* Content Delivery Network (CDN): The CDN is responsible for caching static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files, and is implemented using a CDN service such as Amazon CloudFront or Google Cloud CDN. 

## High Availability and Scalability 

The infrastructure architecture of the Genetix Webapp is designed to support high availability and scalability. This is achieved through the following mechanisms: 

* Load balancing: Web requests are distributed across multiple web server instances, ensuring that no single server is overloaded. 

* Auto-scaling: Web server instances can be automatically scaled up or down based on demand, using an auto-scaling service such as Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling or Google Cloud Auto Scaling. 

* Database replication: The database server uses master-slave replication to ensure that data is replicated across multiple database instances, ensuring high availability and reliability. 

* CDN caching: Static assets such as images and CSS files are cached on the CDN, reducing the load on the web server and improving performance. 

## Security and Compliance 

The infrastructure architecture of the Genetix Webapp is designed to ensure security and compliance with industry best practices and standards. This is achieved through the following mechanisms: 

* Network security: The infrastructure is protected by firewalls, network ACLs, and security groups, which restrict access to the infrastructure to only authorized parties. 

* Encryption: All data transmitted between clients and the web server is encrypted using HTTPS, and sensitive data such as passwords and registration codes are stored in the database using encryption. 

* Compliance: The infrastructure is designed to comply with industry standards and regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). 

## Monitoring and Logging 

The infrastructure architecture of the Genetix Webapp is designed to support monitoring and logging, allowing for proactive identification of issues and troubleshooting. This is achieved through the following mechanisms: 

* Application monitoring: The application server is monitored using a tool such as PM2, which provides real-time metrics on application performance and availability. 

* Server monitoring: The web and database servers are monitored using a tool such as Amazon CloudWatch or Google Cloud Monitoring, which provides real-time metrics on server performance and availability. 

* Logging: Application and server logs are collected and stored using a tool such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Google Cloud Logging, allowing for troubleshooting and debugging of issues.
