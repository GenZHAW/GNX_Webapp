## Tutorial on Jekyll docs

To learn how to setup a Jekyll / GitHub Actions / GitHub Pages integration, see the [GitHub Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/) guide on the Jekyll docs site.

This project was actually developed as part of the processing of writing that step-by-step guide and there is a link at the end of the doc back to this repo.
