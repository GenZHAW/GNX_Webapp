## Code Structure 

The Genetix Webapp is built using a modern web application stack consisting of a front-end user interface built using React, and a back-end server built using Node.js and Express. The code is organized into several directories based on the functionality they provide: 

* client: This directory contains the React front-end code, including components, styles, and other assets.
* server: This directory contains the Node.js and Express back-end code, including routes, models, and other server-side logic.
* config: This directory contains configuration files for the application, including environment variables and database settings.
* utils: This directory contains utility functions and modules used throughout the application. 

## Code Standards 

To ensure code quality and consistency, the Genetix Webapp follows the following standards: 

* Code is written in ES6+ JavaScript, with code linting enforced using ESLint.
* Code is formatted using Prettier, with formatting rules enforced using a pre-commit hook.
* Code is tested using Jest and Supertest, with code coverage reports generated using Istanbul.
* Code is documented using JSDoc comments, with documentation generated using a documentation generator such as JSDoc. 

## Development Process 

The Genetix Webapp development process follows the following steps: 

* Requirements gathering: Gather requirements from stakeholders, and document them as user stories or use cases.
* Design: Create a design for the application, including wireframes and UI mockups.
* Development: Write code according to the requirements and design, adhering to the coding standards described above.
* Testing: Write automated tests for the code, and perform manual testing to ensure the application meets the requirements.
* Deployment: Deploy the application to a production environment, following best practices for security and scalability. 

## API Documentation 

The Genetix Webapp API is documented using the OpenAPI 3.0 specification, which provides a machine-readable description of the API endpoints, parameters, and responses. The API documentation is generated automatically using a tool such as Swagger UI or ReDoc, and is made available to developers and stakeholders. 

## Version Control 

The Genetix Webapp code is managed using a version control system such as Git, with a repository hosted on a platform such as GitHub or GitLab. Branches are used for feature development and bug fixing, with pull requests used for code review and merging changes into the main branch. Commits are made frequently, with descriptive commit messages and linked to the relevant issue or user story. 

## Continuous Integration and Deployment 

The Genetix Webapp follows a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process to ensure code quality and automate deployment to production. This process includes the following steps: 

* Code is pushed to the Git repository.
* Automated tests are run using a CI tool such as Jenkins or Travis CI.
* If the tests pass, the code is deployed to a staging environment for further testing.
* If the staging tests pass, the code is deployed to the production environment. 

This process ensures that code changes are thoroughly tested and deployed quickly and reliably.
